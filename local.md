# Running Projects Locally

### Install
* Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or some other code text editor of your choice)
* Instal [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Project Files
* Create a folder with all of your project files (`sketch.js`, `index.html`, etc.) inside of that folder.

### Terminal
* Open a terminal window and change into the directory where your project is. For example, to get into a Project 1 folder on the Desktop:

```shell
cd ~/Desktop/Project\ 1
```

```shell
npx http-server
```

* Open a web browser and go to `localhost:8080` or whatever URL is posted in your terminal.
