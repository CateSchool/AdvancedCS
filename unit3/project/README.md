# Final Project

Students will analyze and visualize a large data set based on a personally-relevant **theme** (e.g. public health, incarceration, climate change, or affordable housing). You might consider advocating for a particular policy (e.g. pushing the school to divest from fossil fuels), or spreading awareness about a social justice issue (e.g. the school to prison pipeline). **Begin by identifying your goal**, and start to accumulate data sets relevant to your topic.  

The project consists of two parts:

1. **Google CoLab Notebook** - a Python "lab notebook" that documents the process of collecting, cleaning, understanding, and analyzing your data. 
2. **Visual Data Essay** - a web-based report that tells a **coherent, unified story** based on your data analysis. This report mixes interactive visualizations with narrative text.

### 1. Google CoLab Notebook
Using Python and Google CoLab Notebooks, you should create a code-based report that documents your process of understanding the data. Begin by stating your hypotheses about the data. Use quantitative evidence to support or refute these hypotheses. In the process, demonstrate how you cleaned, manipulated, and analyzed the data set(s). 

### 2. Visual Data Essay
Once you have analyzed your data, you need to present the information and conclusions in a compelling and engaging web-based report that combines narrative text and interactive data visualizations. The report should include:

* **5 visualizations taking different analytical approaches** (e.g. bar charts, scatter plots, maps, time series, pie charts, histograms, or something completely innovative). 
  * You can use p5.js, d3.js, or other libraries (e.g. three.js!)
  * *At least 3* of your visualizations must include some form of **interaction**. 
  
* **Written explanations, context, and analysis** to support the visual narrative and make a persuasive argument about your topic. This text can be intermixed with the visuals (>= 400 words).

Each visualization should: 

* Have its own Javascript file but be embedded within the HTML report
* Include documentation
  * Whenever relevant, include axis labels, units, titles, and legends.
  * Include a link to the data source in a comment in the code, as well as a citation of the source (for example, a label at the bottom of the chart)
