## Repl.it
Repl.it will be the platform we use to do assignments, collaborate on projects, and much more! Open the pane on the left-hand side to see project files:  

1. **instructions.md**: I will put **assignment instructions** *in markdown*, so start each assignment by checking the **instructions.md** page (under files on the left-side. panel).   
Note: this file (like *instructions.md*) is a **markdown** file (.md file extension). Markdown has its own syntax and is used by programmers to create text-based instructions, tutorials, and other notes. If you're curious about it, read more [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)!

2. **script.js**: where we will write code (JavaScript)

3. **index.html**: an HTML file that loads our script and libraries (p5.js). We will talk more about HTML at a later date.


## console.log()

Sometimes we will want to print values as our code runs (primarily for debugging our program). Add the following code to the script.js and see the output in the "Console" tab.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

"Hello World" is a string (text). We can also print numbers, mathematical expressions, and more.


```javascript
console.log(2.5);
console.log(3 + 6 / 2);
```

## comments
Comments in programming are a way to document our code and leave human-readable notes for other programmers. It is good practice to frequently use comments.

```javascript
// single line comment for humans!
console.log("for computers");

/*
    Multi-line comment
    
    Great for code headers (name, date, source, etc.), 
    explaining functions,...
*/
```
