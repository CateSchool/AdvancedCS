# Data Structures Presentations

You will work in teams of 2-3 to prepare materials and subsequently teach a lesson on one of the following data structures:

1. Linked lists
   1. Focus on single and double linked lists
   2. Mention Stacks / Queues
2. Trees
   1. Focus on binary search trees
3. Graphs


## Requirements

### Working Prototype
Your group should have an example of your data structure working inside of a repl that you share with me. You are welcome to copy code from the internet, but you should make sure that (if I were to ask any member of the group) that you generally have a sense of what the code is doing.

### Presentation (~20 min)
The following presentation topics are a recommendation, but please feel free to format your lesson in any way that best conveys your topic. For example, feel free to weave your exercise(s) into your presentation.

* Overview
  * What is this data structure?
  * What does it look like? (visual)
  * What are the different types or ways to describe this data structure  (if applicable)?
  * What are the use cases of this data structure?
* Demo prototype
  * Show examples of ways you interact with the data structure (e.g. insert, delete, etc.)
* Code Implementation
  * How can you convey the gist without losing your peers?
    * Using a visual like a UML class diagram
    * What are the important algorithms? 
    * Try to hit the sweet spot of giving enough information to help them learn but without overcomplicating or getting too lost in the weeds
* Big O / Average Case / Omega O
  * Briefly explain relevant time / space complexities for various scenarios:
    * access, search, insertion, deletion

### Exercise(s)
Your group should develop at least one straight-forward exercise on Repl to help students cement their knowledge of this data structure. Use the existing repls as examples of what this exercise could / should look like. Feel free to discuss and work with Ms. deBB.
